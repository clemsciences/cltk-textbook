    "I am Dr. William Mattingly. I hold a PhD in Medieval History from the University of Kentucky where I explored early medieval social networks. A lot of my research was aided by my ability to code, specifically in Python, for data cleaning and analysis. I was even able to use Python to plot and visualize social networks and data. During the fourth year of my PhD, I used Python to create an app that I could use to plot and analyze these social networks. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow for the Analysis of Historical Documents at the Smithsonian Institution with a joint appointment at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. In both institutions, I use Python, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze historical texts in large quantities to generate new insights about the documents held in the archives. In all, I have nearly a decade of experience using Python as a historian.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I first started to explore Python, there were not many available tutorials geared towards humanists and, for that reason, four years ago I started PythonHumanities.com and Python Tutorials for Digital Humanities on YouTube. I geared these resources to humanists who had no prior knowledge about computing or coding. This new JupyterBook is the third iteration of this textbook that brings a lot of the material that first appeared on PythonHumanities.com years ago into a new, more accessible JupyterBook. It will forever remain free to all as will the video lectures embedded in this book."

    "The <a href=\"www.cltk.org\">Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK)</a> is a Python library for performing natural langauge processing (NLP) on ancient and medieval languages. It was created by <a href=\"https://github.com/kylepjohnson\">Kyle P. Johnson</a> in 2014 to address the lack of resources for doing NLP on pre-modern languages. These languages suffer from several notable drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- limited texts\n",
    "- no living native speakers\n",
    "- inconsistent encoding\n",
    "- limited funding\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these factors make pre-modern languages low-resource languages. The CLTK library resolves many of these issues by providing the data (texts), models (stanza and spaCy) and pipelines (CLTK) for processing pre-modern texts."

    "Other available NLP libraries in Python, such as spaCy and Stanza, are powerful tools. They are not, however, necessarily equipped to handle some of the challenges pre-modern languages face. SpaCy cannot, for example, work with Arabic due to its right-to-left style. The CLTK was designed by researchers who are intimately familiar with the challenges of the languages they study. It was built from the ground up to address those specific challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chief reason to use the CLTK is, therefore, so that you do not need to reinvent the wheel. Rather than coding solutions to problems you are seeing with Old English, leverage the prebuilt pipelines CLTK offers. As you become familiar with the CLTK, you will undoubtedly find things you wish to improve. As you do, you can code your own solutions and make a formal request for CLTK to adopt those changes via GitHub."
